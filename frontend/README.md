# Todo List Fullstack Project

This project is a **full workflow example** for building a Todo List application, focusing on the complete development lifecycle: **frontend, backend, and infrastructure**.

## About

- **Frontend:** Built with Vue 3 and Vite, using `<script setup>` SFCs for a modern, efficient UI.
- **Backend:** (To be implemented) Will provide RESTful APIs or GraphQL for managing todos.
- **Infrastructure:** (To be implemented) Will include CI/CD pipelines, environment configuration, and deployment scripts.

## Goals

- Demonstrate best practices for a fullstack application.
- Show how to structure, test, and deploy both frontend and backend.
- Provide a reference for setting up CI/CD and infrastructure as code.
